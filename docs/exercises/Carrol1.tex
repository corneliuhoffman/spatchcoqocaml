 \begin{enumerate}
 \item If some a are b and some not, some c are not d;
 
 \item If some e are f and if some g are h, some j are k;
 \item  If all l are m, no n are p
\item If some c are d and some not, some g are h;
\item If no e are f, and if some n are p, some j are not k; 
\item If some e are not f and if some g are not h, some n are p; 
\item If some c are not d, and if some j are k, no e are f;
\item If some g are not h, and if some j are not k, some l are m
\item  If some e are not f, and if some n are p, some a are not b; 
\item  If some a are b, and if some c are d, some g are not h;
\item  If some c are not d, and if some l are not m, some e are f
 \end{enumerate}
 Show that if some a are b and if some e are not f then no c are d.
