\section{Introducing the GUI}
\subsection{Main windows}
Figure~\ref{first look} is a view of the GUI. As you can see there are 4 different windows and three buttons.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Green window  : This is the window that keeps the text that has already been processed.
\item The Yellow window ': This is the only window you can type your commands into.
\item The Gray  window : this is the Coq feedback window. 
\item The White window : this is a window for messages.
\item The run button: this sends the first line from the input window to Coq.
\item The undo button: this undoes the last command.
\item The draw tree button: this draws the proof trees for all the completed theorems.
\item The symbol buttons: These allows one to type mathematical symbols.
\item The Search box/button: These allow searching for theorems by pattern.
\end{enumerate}

The File menu (Figure \ref{file}) is quite standard:

The Tactics menu (Figure \ref{tactics}) allows one to pick one of the predefined tactics. 
Note the place keeper VAR. 
These can be modified. More on these later.

Pressing ESC autocompletes the commands and pressing \VAR circles around the various possibilities for VAR.
